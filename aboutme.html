<html><h1></h1><h1>What is there to know About Me!!
    <h1 style="text-transform: lowercase;"></h1>My name is Luis Antonio Cruz Urban, I'm a college freshman studying Computer Science as my major at the "University of Rhode Island", I just recently enrolled in the CSC 106 program "The Joy of Programming" where I have learned where to code my own website! I have had some experience in the past when it comes to computers such as "Cyber Security" which I studied in highschool and also earned a certificate in "IT and Cisco Networking." I'm really excited to learn and have a basis in programming to further my knowledge in the technology field.

</p>One of my favorite things to do is working out! I started working out about 2 years ago and during that time I have made insane process! I also really like playing and watching sports such as football, baseball, and boxing. One of my favorite teams from each sport are the New York Yankees, Real Madrid, and my favorite boxer Mike Tyson. My favorite thing to do would have to be going out, I like going shopping and I also like the outdoors such as fishing and camping.
